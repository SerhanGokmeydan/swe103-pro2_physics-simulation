# swe103-pro2_physics-simulation

This project is developed by using C++ and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/), and it's a simple physics simulation that simulates rigid-soft body physics, spring physics and mechanic physics based on real world calculations.

## Features

* **Particul Physics:** Each ball have properties such as mass, gravity, friction etc.
* **Soft-Body:** Baloon like shapes made of balls and springs.
* **Springs:** Vertical lines that works like a spring, and trys to protect the distance between two balls.
* **Advanced Collision Detection:** Every object at the screen can touch eachothers.
* **Interaction:** Objects can be pulled and be thrown by the mouse.

## Setup

### Requirements

The followings have to be installed on your computer:
* A C++ compiler (g++, Clang, MSVS etc.)
* **SFML 2.6** or higher version (put it into lib folder that is located in your project folder)

### Compile

In Visual Studio Code, create `.vscode` folder then create `c_cpp_properties.json` and `tasks.json` files in `.vscode`.

```bash
// c_cpp_properties.json
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Win32",
            "includePath": [
                "${workspaceFolder}/**",
                "${workspaceFolder}/lib/SFML-3.0.2/include"
            ],
            "defines": [
                "_DEBUG",
                "UNICODE",
                "_UNICODE"
            ],
            "windowsSdkVersion": "10.0.26100.0",
            "compilerPath": "your compiler path",
            "cStandard": "c17",
            "cppStandard": "c++17",
            "intelliSenseMode": "windows-gcc-x64"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}
```

```bash
// tasks.json
{
    "tasks": [
        {
            "type": "cppbuild",
            "label": "C/C++: g++.exe build active file",
            "command": "your compiler's exe file path",
            "args": [
                "-fdiagnostics-color=always",
                "-g",
                "${workspaceFolder}/src/*.cpp",
                "${workspaceFolder}/src/graphs/*.cpp",
                "${workspaceFolder}/src/physics/*.cpp",
                "-o",
                "${workspaceFolder}/build/${workspaceFolderBasename}.exe",
                "-I${workspaceFolder}/lib/SFML-3.0.2/include",
                "-L${workspaceFolder}/lib/SFML-3.0.2/lib",
                "-DSFML_STATIC",

                "-lopengl32",
                "-lfreetype",
                "-lwinmm",
                "-lgdi32"
            ],
            "options": {
                "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
            },
            "problemMatcher": ["$gcc"],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            },
            "detail": "Task generated by Debugger."
        }
    ],
    "version": "2.0.0"
}
```
### Running

Build application and run the .exe file.
